# Comparative-Study-On-Classification-Models-for-Western-Notation-to-Carnatic-Notation
Image processing models are used with the help of transfer learning and classification is done using 4 models, of which 3 are pre-trained, i.e., ResNet50, VGG16, InceptionV3 and one is a simple CNN model. The models provide competitive results when compared to human experts labelling of datasets.
